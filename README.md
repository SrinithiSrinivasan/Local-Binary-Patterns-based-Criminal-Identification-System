# Local-Binary-Patterns-based-Criminal-Identification-System
The application takes an image as input and produces an output as to whether he/she is a criminal or not. If it is labelled to be a criminal image, a summary of the crime he/she was accused for is generated by extracting keywords from a corresponding criminal report. The application is coded in Python. 
Create a test and training data set with desired number of facial images. Name the files as test-data and training-data respectively.
